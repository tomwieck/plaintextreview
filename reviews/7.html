    <h1>Disclosure - Alchemy</h1>
    <h2>★★★★☆</h2>
    <img src="../img/alchemy.png">
    <p>Return to form for Disclosure, opting to go for a no feature surprise release compared to their stacked no expenses spared previous few albums. Feels more like original Settle, clean production with no samples and even a cheeky jungle track. Best songs, Looking For Love, Simply Won't Do, Higher Than Ever Before, Go The Distance, We Were In Love, basically the whole first half of the album.</p>
    <p>Also fun fact, the B side / remixes uses the opposite side of the custom made fabric album cover as a "reverse" side, thought that was neat.</p>
