    <h1>Luncie - Open</h1>
    <h2>★★★★☆</h2>

    <p>Distinct and confident sound throughout, obviously makes what he wants when he wants with the sole reason being to get people dancing. YAYAYA huge opener, Life Happening, Last Time grows on you, make Face feeling like old school TNGHT, No Commas sounds like something from Baauers Planets Mad with strange but catchy vocals, finishing on Red Congo, just a straight bop.</p>
